// This repository contains project 5 for CS 290 for Spring 2018.

This project features the games of Mancala and Backgammon in a text based format.

The program is buggy, but the logic is all present.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through Java.
