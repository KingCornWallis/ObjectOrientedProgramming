// This repository contains project 2 for CS 290 for Spring 2018.

This is a simpler version of the (once-famous) text-based adventure game Zorke.

In this particular game, you find yourself in a haunted house and must find a way to the end.

While it is considered 'cheating', a map has been made available for ease of use.

View the README inside the nested project folder for more instructions.

This project is implemented through Java.
