// This repository contains project 3 for CS 290 for Spring 2018.

The purpose of this project is to create a custom figure to use in JHotDraw.

This is a relatively simple project; the code provided creates a "Rectangle with an Ellipse inside of it" object.

The entire project has too many supporting files to be included on Github, only the parts
I programmed are included.

This project is implemented through Java.
